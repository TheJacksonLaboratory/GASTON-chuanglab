GASTON - Mapping the topography of spatial gene expression with interpretable deep learning
===========================================================================================

GASTON is an interpretable deep learning model for learning the _topography_ of a tissue slice, using spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) data. Specifically, GASTON models gene expression topography by learning the _isodepth_, a 1-D coordinate describing tissue geometry (i.e. spatial domains) and continuous gene expression gradients.
